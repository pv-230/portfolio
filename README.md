# Web Development Portfolio

This is my web development portofolio that I initially created as the last front end project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio). I plan to make updates to the portfolio over time as I learn new skills and create new projects.
